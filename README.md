## Setup instructions

### Recreating databases locally

You can install PostgreSQL on your own machine and load the database dump files provided in the `databases/` folder to locally recreate the databases used in the workshop for further practicing. The instructions to do so are provided [here](local-setup-instructions.ipynb).

### Notebook environment

The Jupyter notebooks in this repository use a few packages to run SQL commands within the Python environment of the notebooks, which are all provided in the [`environment.yml`](environment.yml). In order to reproduce this environment and make it accessible to Jupyter Lab, you need to install the `nb_conda_kernels` package in your `base` environment (or whichever environment Jupyter Lab is installed in) using the following command in your terminal:

```
conda install nb_conda_kernels
```

Then run the following command to recreate the environment

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

A new environment called `ssc2022` should appear in the list of kernels when you launch Jupyter Lab on your computer.
